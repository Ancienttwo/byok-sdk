# Product Spec: byok-sdk

> **Status**: Draft

Describe the product intent, users, workflows, acceptance scenarios, and constraints before implementation.

## Canonical Terms

- **subscription lane** — a dispatch through the user's existing Claude Code
  or Codex CLI login. The vendor CLI owns authentication; BYOK selects only
  the runtime and model and never reads or forwards provider credentials.
- **BYOK lane** — a Pi dispatch using a host-configured provider profile. When
  that profile requires authentication, its user-supplied key is held in the
  operating-system credential store. A credential-custody launcher, isolated
  from the dispatch process, projects the selected provider/model to Pi and
  injects only the required key into the Pi child environment.
- **provider projection** — the deterministic, credential-blind `models.json`
  representation of one selected BYOK provider/model. Pi remains the sole
  provider registry, transport, and agent-loop authority; the projection is
  immutable for one process and failures never fall back to another target.

## Core pi runtime contract

Pi is a required BYOK capability. `@byok-sdk/client` depends on the exact npm
artifact `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.84.1`; the SDK does not accept an
unversioned global `pi` on `PATH` as an implicit substitute. All workspace
dispatch packages and private conformance tests require Node.js `>=22.19.0`,
matching pi's published engine floor. The independent
`@byok-sdk/keys@0.1.0` package remains outside the dispatch graph and retains
its Node.js 20 floor. A host that enables the BYOK lane installs its
`byok-pi-provider-launcher` binary separately and gives the client only the
launcher command plus non-secret profile/session paths; this executable
process boundary does not create a package dependency edge.
The coding-agent package owns and installs its non-optional `pi-agent-core`,
`pi-ai`, `pi-client`, `pi-protocol`, and `pi-tui` dependencies. BYOK does not
declare or import those packages separately because the CLI/RPC boundary is
the sole version authority.

The package manager is not the runtime authority. This repository uses pnpm,
and downstream pnpm projects install the standard npm registry artifact through
pnpm's isolated layout. A downstream may use `bun install` to materialize the
same dependency, but supported production execution remains Node.js 22.19 or
newer. Bun runtime compatibility is not claimed. A Bun-compiled or Node SEA
single-file launcher cannot embed pi's external CLI package; that deployment
must provide the version-matched, Node-executed pi sidecar explicitly through
`BYOK_PI_BIN`.

The pi RPC boundary is also version-specific. `message_update` is delta-only;
BYOK assembles progress from `assistantMessageEvent.delta`. `agent_end` closes
one low-level agent run and is not task completion. Only `agent_settled`, which
arrives after automatic retry, compaction, and queued continuations are done,
maps to BYOK `turn_end`. The SDK does not carry parallel 0.74.x semantics.

## Skill pack delivery

A SaaS product using this SDK can distribute curated, declarative content — an
`agentskills.io`-compatible `SKILL.md` plus its static companion files — to the
coding agents running on its users' machines. The channel is pull-based: a
deployment publishes a tenant-scoped catalogue, and a paired device fetches,
verifies and installs from it. Nothing is pushed into a task.

Availability is a declaration, not a discovery: a deployment that serves the
channel names `skills.pack` in its capability declaration, and a device that
does not read that name installs nothing and reports why. There is no probing of
endpoints and no interpretation of status codes.

A skill pack carries content and nothing else. Its manifest has no field for a
command, an entrypoint, a hook, an environment variable, or a credential, and a
manifest carrying one is rejected rather than ignored. The same rule applies to
the `SKILL.md` frontmatter, which may declare only a name and a description.
This is the credential-isolation boundary stated in a second place: the channel
cannot deliver something to execute, so no downstream host has to decide whether
to execute it.

Every limit the channel declares is enforced where the bytes arrive. The device
checks each file's path against a relative-path rule that cannot express a
parent-directory hop or an absolute path, measures each file and the pack total
in bytes against fixed caps, verifies each file's sha256 against the manifest,
re-derives the pack's own content hash from its file rows, and validates the
entry file's frontmatter. Any failure refuses the whole pack; there is no
partial install and no degraded mode.

An installed pack lives in the SDK's own store under
`<dataDir>/skill-packs/<name>/<content-hash>/`, with a `lock.json` recording the
content hash, the source deployment, the install time, and the file list, plus
an append-only audit line for each install, refusal, and projection. Because the
revision directory is content-addressed and the lock is written last, a
re-install of unchanged content is a no-op and an interrupted install never
replaces a working pack.

Where a vendor CLI keeps its skills is host policy, not SDK policy. The SDK owns
its store and exposes two calls — list what is installed, and project one pack
into a directory the host names. Projection copies bytes rather than linking
them, and re-verifies each file against the lock on the way out; the SDK never
writes into `~/.claude/skills` or any equivalent directory on a host's behalf.

## Local Git task workspaces

The client optionally provides local Git checkpoint workspaces for operators who want a consistent, recoverable code-state convention around connected coding agents. The feature is disabled by default and is enabled only by the local daemon configuration:

```ts
{
  gitWorkspace: { mode: 'local-checkpoints' }
}
```

With the option absent, the daemon preserves the existing plain `workspaceRoot/<taskId>` behavior and performs no Git subprocesses. With the option enabled, the daemon preflights Git before accepting offers, initializes each fresh daemon-owned task directory as a local repository, and records coarse recovery state in a private local ledger. The server protocol still owns task lifecycle: offer, claim, approval, cancellation, completion, and failure. Git records code state and human-reviewable checkpoints only; a commit or dirty status never transitions a protocol task.

### Operator configuration and workspace contract

The operator supplies the same ordinary daemon configuration fields as before, plus the optional `gitWorkspace` object. This MVP does not attach an existing user checkout or search parent directories. Git-enabled work is limited to daemon-owned `workspaceRoot/<taskId>` directories, or the exact directory already mapped to a compatible `sessionRef`. A workspace-root ownership marker prevents another Git-enabled daemon from claiming the root, and an in-process lease provides one-writer semantics for a canonical workspace and requested session. A busy or incompatible workspace is declined before claim so it can be retried without mutating task state.

The fixed runtime guidance asks the agent to work only in the provided directory, inspect status before and after edits, make small ordinary checkpoint commits after coherent verified units when an identity is already configured, avoid changing identity, avoid network/destructive/history Git operations, and leave incomplete work visible. This is operational guidance, not a sandbox or OS-level enforcement boundary.

The daemon never makes automatic commits, runs `git add`, configures or changes identity, performs network Git (`clone`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push`), rewrites history (`rebase`, `merge`, `reset`, `stash`, or branch switching), cleans files, deletes branches, or deletes workspaces. It preserves task files and `.git` through failure, cancellation, shutdown, and interruption. Git observations are bounded and reduced to commit IDs/counts and dirty counts; raw Git output, filenames, commit messages, and paths do not enter server envelopes or ordinary audit output.

### Recovery and redispatch

The private `<storeDir>/git-workspaces.json` ledger records opaque identifiers, the local workspace directory, optional session reference, phase, baseline/current IDs when available, commits since baseline, coarse dirty counts, timestamps, and stable error categories. It is atomically written, serialized, bounded, and secured with the existing private-store controls; corrupt or future-version data fails closed. On startup, old `preparing`/`active` records become `interrupted` after read-only reconciliation. This does not revive a protocol task or emit a wire message. A later valid redispatch can reuse the preserved exact workspace only when its session mapping and matching Git ledger record are present; a legacy plain session is incompatible while Git mode is enabled.

`SessionWorkspaceStore.workspaceKind` has one bounded migration meaning: records written before Git workspaces omit it, and omission is read as `plain`. This tolerance is owned by the client persistence format, not product semantics or the wire. Its removal trigger is a versioned store migration that rewrites every surviving entry with an explicit kind and ships for one supported release; after readback shows no unversioned entries, `workspaceKind` becomes required and the missing-field branch is deleted. Until that migration exists, Git mode continues to reject an omitted/`plain` record rather than converting it.

The local read-only operator view is:

```text
byok-agent workspaces [--show-paths] [--config <path>]
```

It reads the private ledger without refreshing or mutating repositories. Paths are hidden unless `--show-paths` is explicitly supplied. On Windows, private storage depends on restrictive DACL hardening and fails closed before writing if that hardening cannot be applied.

Operational rollback is deliberately simple: remove `gitWorkspace` from the local configuration and restart the daemon. Existing Git directories, task files, and private ledger records are preserved for manual salvage; no cleanup or deletion command is part of this MVP.
