Describe the product intent, users, workflows, acceptance scenarios, and constraints before implementation.

## Local Git task workspaces

The client optionally provides local Git checkpoint workspaces for operators who want a consistent, recoverable code-state convention around connected coding agents. The feature is disabled by default and is enabled only by the local daemon configuration:

```ts
{
  gitWorkspace: { mode: 'local-checkpoints' }
}
```

With the option absent, the daemon preserves the existing plain `workspaceRoot/<taskId>` behavior and performs no Git subprocesses. With the option enabled, the daemon preflights Git before accepting offers, initializes each fresh daemon-owned task directory as a local repository, and records coarse recovery state in a private local ledger. The server protocol still owns task lifecycle: offer, claim, approval, cancellation, completion, and failure. Git records code state and human-reviewable checkpoints only; a commit or dirty status never transitions a protocol task.

### Operator configuration and workspace contract

The operator supplies the same ordinary daemon configuration fields as before, plus the optional `gitWorkspace` object. This MVP does not attach an existing user checkout or search parent directories. Git-enabled work is limited to daemon-owned `workspaceRoot/<taskId>` directories, or the exact directory already mapped to a compatible `sessionRef`. A workspace-root ownership marker prevents another Git-enabled daemon from claiming the root, and an in-process lease provides one-writer semantics for a canonical workspace and requested session. A busy or incompatible workspace is declined before claim so it can be retried without mutating task state.

The fixed runtime guidance asks the agent to work only in the provided directory, inspect status before and after edits, make small ordinary checkpoint commits after coherent verified units when an identity is already configured, avoid changing identity, avoid network/destructive/history Git operations, and leave incomplete work visible. This is operational guidance, not a sandbox or OS-level enforcement boundary.

The daemon never makes automatic commits, runs `git add`, configures or changes identity, performs network Git (`clone`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push`), rewrites history (`rebase`, `merge`, `reset`, `stash`, or branch switching), cleans files, deletes branches, or deletes workspaces. It preserves task files and `.git` through failure, cancellation, shutdown, and interruption. Git observations are bounded and reduced to commit IDs/counts and dirty counts; raw Git output, filenames, commit messages, and paths do not enter server envelopes or ordinary audit output.

### Recovery and redispatch

The private `<storeDir>/git-workspaces.json` ledger records opaque identifiers, the local workspace directory, optional session reference, phase, baseline/current IDs when available, commits since baseline, coarse dirty counts, timestamps, and stable error categories. It is atomically written, serialized, bounded, and secured with the existing private-store controls; corrupt or future-version data fails closed. On startup, old `preparing`/`active` records become `interrupted` after read-only reconciliation. This does not revive a protocol task or emit a wire message. A later valid redispatch can reuse the preserved exact workspace only when its session mapping and matching Git ledger record are present; a legacy plain session is incompatible while Git mode is enabled.

The local read-only operator view is:

```text
byok-agent workspaces [--show-paths] [--config <path>]
```

It reads the private ledger without refreshing or mutating repositories. Paths are hidden unless `--show-paths` is explicitly supplied. On Windows, private storage depends on restrictive DACL hardening and fails closed before writing if that hardening cannot be applied.

Operational rollback is deliberately simple: remove `gitWorkspace` from the local configuration and restart the daemon. Existing Git directories, task files, and private ledger records are preserved for manual salvage; no cleanup or deletion command is part of this MVP.
