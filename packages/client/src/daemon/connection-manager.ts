   * `advanceCursor(2)` synchronously, BEFORE `process(seq1)` had even
   * started, let alone failed. If `seq1`'s handler then failed,
   * `stalledAtSeq` became 1 — but the durable cursor was already 2, so
   * `dedupWatermark()` returned 2, and every future redelivery of seq1 was
   * dedup-dropped as "already past the cursor" forever: permanent envelope
   * loss, exactly the F3 bug class the whole `stalledAtSeq`/frozen-watermark
   * mechanism exists to prevent.
   *
   * Fix: the cursor-advancing half is now CHAINED onto `processingChain`
   * too, exactly like `process()`'s own post-handler bookkeeping — so it
   * only ever runs once every earlier envelope already queued ahead of it
   * has fully settled (success or failure), and can observe `stalledAtSeq`'s
   * REAL, up-to-date value rather than whatever it happened to be at the
   * instant the skip was first noticed. The guard mirrors `process()`'s own
   * success-path guard exactly: never advance past a still-unresolved
   * earlier failure, unless (degenerate, cannot really happen for a skip)
   * this exact seq IS the stalled one.
   *
   * `noteDelivered` (the eager, in-memory watermark) stays UNCHAINED —
   * called immediately, unconditionally, regardless of `stalledAtSeq` —
   * matching `deliver()`'s own eager, unconditional call for a real
   * envelope: its only job is "don't re-pull something already handed off,"
   * independent of outcome, and that property does not depend on FIFO
   * ordering the way the DURABLE cursor does.
   *
   * Deliberately NO top-level `dedupWatermark() <= seq` early-return before
   * queuing the chained callback (an earlier draft of this fix had one, and
   * it was itself subtly wrong): `deliveredSeq` can already reflect a seq
   * from the FIRST time it was ever seen, while the DURABLE cursor is still
   * behind it because a stall intervened before that seq's chained
   * advancement ran — a pre-check keyed on `deliveredSeq` would then
   * wrongly treat a LATER redelivery of the same seq (arriving once the
   * stall has since cleared) as "already accounted for" and never queue
   * another attempt, permanently stranding the cursor one seq short. Always
   * queuing is safe and cheap: `advanceCursor`'s own `seq <= this.cursor`
   * guard already makes a genuinely-redundant call a no-op, so there is no
   * correctness reason to short-circuit earlier, only a (here, unnecessary)
   * micro-optimization one.
