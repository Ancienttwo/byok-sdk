# Hosted Bot collaboration (H)

Private reference example for #793 (#606 D2). It is the hosted (H) adapter of the K8 collaboration
commit contract (`examples/bot-collaboration`, #739 D1), on Node and Postgres.

Status: the commit store and the intent submitter (D2b-1). The Turn freeze in the sync step (D2b-2), the
message consumer, result reconciliation, the command entry, the routine scheduler and retention come in
later slices of #793. Do not use this example as a deployed Host yet.

## Commit store

`HostedCollaborationStore` runs one command through the D1 commit contract in one Postgres
transaction. The transaction holds the state change, the command record and the outbox rows.

- A commit first upserts its scope row and then locks it, so the commits of one scope run one at a time.
- A replay returns the first result and writes nothing. A throw rolls back every row.
- H has no K4 ledger, so the store also records the terminal and message callbacks.
- The caller passes the scope that the authenticated product user owns. A request for another scope is
  a `scope_mismatch` conflict.
- A scope row of an unknown store version is refused before any write. `read()` refuses it too.

## Intent submitter

`freezeIntent` saves one intent for a Turn: the frozen SDK input and the stable task id `taskId(turnId, 0)`
of K4. The caller holds the scope lock. D2b-2 calls it in the Turn's sync transaction.

`HostedSubmitter.run()` takes the due rows and runs the K4 rules on them: the FIFO head (`fifoHeads`), the
queued expiry (`queuedExpiry`) and the frozen submit (`submitFrozen`).

- A try first raises `tries` and takes a lease, under the scope lock. Then it calls the SDK.
- Every write after the SDK call is fenced: `WHERE tries = $mine AND submission <> 'delivered'`. A stale
  submitter cannot overwrite a newer try, and a delivered row never changes back.
- A row that was never tried expires at `wait_until`. A tried row past `wait_until` is never submitted
  again. It gets `cancel_reason = 'expired'` and no conclusion, because an SDK attempt can still exist.
  Reconciliation (D2d) checks the attempt first.
- A delivered head holds its agent's queue until it has a conclusion.
- The SDK input never changes, and the task id never changes. After a lost response, a readback finds the
  offer, and no second submit runs.

## Tables

`src/ddl.ts` holds the DDL. The statements are unqualified, and `migrate()` runs them in the store's own
schema. The SDK tables stay under the SDK migrations. This example never writes them.

| Table | One row per |
|---|---|
| `scope` | scope: the store version and the frame (the state without its rows) |
| `entity` | map entry of the state (Turn, card, Bot, room, delivery, ...), keyed by its id |
| `entry` | element of a list (audit, rejected, team note, home operation, room message), keyed by position |
| `command` | command record: the dedup evidence, the first result and the retention root (nullable) |
| `outbox` | projection or delivery that a commit wrote |
| `intent` | Turn intent: the frozen SDK input, the stable task id, the FIFO order and the submit state |

Each scope and each key is stored as `JSON.stringify(value)`, so two values that UTF-8 would merge stay
apart, and a NUL is safe. Each body is `json` text, so the stored bytes keep their key order. `ordinal`
keeps the insertion order of each kind.

## Accepted limits

- A commit loads every row of its scope, except the command records: it loads only the one record that
  it can replay. Retention, after #798, bounds the scope rows.
- When a list gets shorter, the positions of its later elements are renumbered. No K8 list gets shorter
  today. Retention needs a base offset, so that positions never change.
- The `kind` CHECK lists come from the layout at the first `migrate()`. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  keeps the old CHECK, so a new kind needs an explicit `ALTER` in a later migration.
- One commit must not delete a map key and add it back. The store keeps the old ordinal, but a JavaScript
  object moves the key to the end. K8 never deletes a map entry today.

## Database

One Postgres database can hold the SDK tables and this example's schema. The store takes its own
`pg.Pool`, so a separate database also works. No path assumes one atomic commit across the store and an
SDK call.

## Tests

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --wait
BYOK_TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://byok:byok@127.0.0.1:5433/byok_test bun run --cwd examples/hosted-bot-collaboration test
```

Without `BYOK_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`, the Postgres suites skip. With `BYOK_REQUIRE_DATAPLANE=1`, a missing URL
is a failure. The CI `dataplane` job sets both and runs these suites.

- The D1 commit vectors run on the store and on a reference subject (the pure rules in memory).
- The submitter tests use a real SDK server and a real daemon, paired over loopback HTTP (the K4 test
  fixture, on its SQLite storage). The intents are frozen directly, because D2b ships no product entry.
- After each step of two command scripts, the store's state bytes equal the reference subject's state bytes.
